# Maze Solver CLI - Java

## Overview
Maze Solver CLI is a Java-based command-line application that finds all possible paths from a start (`S`) to an end (`E`) point in a maze. The project demonstrates the use of **DFS, BFS, and backtracking algorithms** to efficiently solve mazes of different sizes with multiple possible routes.

---

## Features
- Solve mazes of **customizable sizes** (e.g., 5x5, 7x7).  
- Supports **multiple routes** from start to end.  
- Provides **visual representation** of walls (`#`), paths (`_`), start (`S`), and end (`E`).  
- Uses **2D arrays** to represent the maze and efficient **pathfinding algorithms**.  
- Interactive CLI for **user input and solution display**.

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java  
- **Concepts:** Data Structures (2D Arrays, Stack/Queue), Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Backtracking), OOP Design  
- **Tools:** Command-Line Interface

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bhosaleparas/Mazesolver.git

2. Compile the java program
    ```bash
    javac MazeSolver.java

3. Run the program:
    ```bash
    java MazeSolver

4. Input your custom maze or select a predefined maze to see all possible paths.
